In this space is available a backup of the code and files used on the 2nd Lab for the Deep Learning class, headed by √Ålvaro Soto, in the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. 

This Lab has 2 main exercises using Keras on top of Tensorflow:  

-CNN (Convulsional Neural Networks) using AlexNet - located in folder Lab2-Code-Act1-7  
-RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) using traditional RNN and Long Short Term Memory on the International Airlines Passengers csv dataset - located at Lab2-Code-Act8-11
